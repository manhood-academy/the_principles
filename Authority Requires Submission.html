<p>To bring a person under your authority, you first need to subdue their will. This means they must be conquered by both positive and negative incentives.
Neither pain nor pleasure can be missing. You must have <em>both</em>. In fact, many authority problems stem from neglecting to supply
incentives from one side.</p>
<p>Today, the United States government has conquered you with both positive and negative incentives. Because your will has been subdued, you seek to obey the laws of the land.</p>
<p>On the positive side, by obeying the laws, you gain the benefits of U.S.
citizenship. You are protected by the police. You have rights granted to you by the Constitution. You can receive welfare benefits and other government assistance if necessary. You get to live in a clean environment, etc. These positive incentives encourage you to submit to the governing authority of the United States.</p>
<p>On the negative side, if you disobey the laws, the police will charge you with a crime. They can arrest you. They can imprison you. You can be fined. You can lose your property.
You can lose your rights. The government can even go so far as to execute you if you disobey certain laws. These negative incentives
serve to ensure your submission to the governing authority over you. [Gaining submission in social interactions will be covered in section III]</p>
<p>Your authority places you in the position of a sheriff. Once a person submits to your authority in a relationship, you are in charge. The responsibility for their welfare now rests on your shoulders. It is now your job to keep them safe and happy.</p>
<p>In return, you should require their full submission. They need to obey your laws (expectations) because they are now under your jurisdiction, receiving the benefits of your care. When you create order with your authority, they benefit from it. When you spend money to buy things, they become the recipients. When you share your knowledge, they get
educated. When you kiss them, they get affection. When you protect them, they get security. When you pay rent, they get shelter. When you correct them, they get discipline. When you feed them, they get nourishment, etc. Your authority allows them to benefit from all that you have to offer.</p>
<p>Those who benefit from the order you create need to be brought into submission to your authority. Once a person agrees to submit to your authority, their submission must be maintained by the application of merited pain and pleasure. Practically speaking, this means you need to <em>discipline</em> bad behavior and <em>reward</em> good behavior.</p>
<p>While the term “authority” still remains acceptable in modern vernacular, its necessary polarity, “submission,” has lost its proper context. Feminists have demonized the concept of submission by associating it with a condemned patriarchal system.</p>
<p>While Webster's dictionary defines <em>submission</em> as: “<em>yielding oneself to the authority or will of another</em>,” many people, especially women, erroneously believe that submission results in a complete loss of identity, personality and choice.</p>
<p>Feminism misleads society into believing that submitting to the will of another automatically results in abuse. Submission is made synonymous with slavery,
and in its most vilified context, female
submission to male authority is depicted as
the pinnacle of misogyny; feminists deem cooking and cleaning evil relics of a contemptible patriarchal system. They mock housewives as inferior women while painting their husbands as unsophisticated, cruel misogynists.</p>
<p>Yet we don’t characterize our relationship with our father as one of slavery. We don’t characterize student-teacher relationships as slavery. We don’t characterize employer-employee relationships as
slavery. We don’t characterize military relationships as slavery. Yet for all of these relationships to function, authority over another person is required.</p>
<p>Intellectually dishonest characterizations of submission and authority undermine objective, rational examination and serve to shut down discussion. Yet, we can easily expose the incompetent
nature of these criticisms by referencing an authority- submission relationship common to everyone’s experience:</p>
<p>From small tribes in Africa to large metropolitan cities across
the United States, people voluntarily submit to some type of governing authority that meets their needs. Nations create agreements (laws) with its citizens, designed to safeguard everyone’s interests. These laws must then
be enforced to protect those interests and thus maintain an orderly society. If these legal agreements
are broken, all lives are put in jeopardy.</p>
<p>For example,
when you exceed the speed limit, you are essentially breaking the legal agreements governing public roads. In doing so, you endanger the lives of those whom the State is legally obligated to protect.</p>
<p>If you steal from a bank, you break the laws designed to protect the
economic interests of its investors. Everyone’s ability to purchase life- sustaining resources is put in jeopardy.</p>
<p>To fulfill its responsibility to its citizens, the State must use its authority to execute a punishment (e.g., fine, jail) against those who breach its legal agreements. Violators must be punished to remove the disorderly condition created by their actions. Enforcing painful consequences brings society back into a state of order.</p>
<p>Whenever people enter into a reciprocal relationship, each side must sacrifice its freedom; those who wield authority must bear the responsibility for everyone’s happiness, even to the point
of sacrificing their own lives. In return, those receiving care are obligated to <em><strong>submit</strong></em> to the
governing authority providing it.</p>
<p><em>Authority</em> is required to enforce your expectations. Your expectations are designed to care for those submitting to your authority.
<em>Submission</em> is the proper attitude/behavior/condition necessary for authority to function. Anything less than submission will result in disorder.</p>
<p>Just as obeying the laws of the State does not suppress your identity or turn you into a slave, submitting to male authority does not
result in oppressive relationships. Both authority and submission are essential to meeting everyone’s
need for order. If either component is missing, both sides will remain unsatisfied.</p>
<p>A wife submitting to her husband’s governing authority doesn’t lose her identity or ability to choose. On the contrary, her submission actually safeguards her freedom. It places her in a proper position to receive her husband’s care and protection. The only “freedom” she loses is the dysfunctional ability to act without restriction. This is no different than immigrants losing the ‘freedom’ to exceed the speed limit, yell fire in a crowded theater, steal from others or
engage in any other unrestricted behaviors once they become lawful
citizens of a nation.</p>
<p>In exchange for her freedom, she gains the right to physical protection, financial support, romance, a strong pair of arms for moving furniture
and changing tires, peace of mind and a satisfying relationship.
Whereas absolute freedom led her to a Wild West lifestyle of confusion and misery, a well-directed life will answer her need for order. Freedom
is meaningless if you must constantly worry about being shot, stabbed,
killed, raped or exploited by an unrestricted society predicated on self- indulgent freedom.</p>
<p>Thus, those who demonize authority and submission are really expressing their childish desire for immediate gratification. They fail to realize that their delusional utopia of absolute freedom will only lead to a complete disregard for human life. Without reciprocation and mutual dependence to guide your actions, human life becomes expendable.
Self-interest always undermines the incentive to care for everyone’s mutual welfare.</p>
<p>Absolute, unrestricted freedom is very dangerous to any society, just as absolute, unrestricted freedom is dangerous to any relationship.
Today, for the first time in history, there are more single people than married people. The high rate of divorce is indicative of society’s contempt for authority and submission. Because of feminism’s emphasis on self-esteem, women are encouraged to “break the law” of reciprocation by refusing to
submit to male authority. Without a functional authority-submission relationship, there is no way to protect the interests of either gender or preserve a peaceful order. Romance will naturally move towards entropy (fights, break-ups and divorce) when its ordering agents (authority &amp; submission) are removed.</p>
<p>Even feminists themselves are
hard-pressed to ignore their own natural gender design. As much as
fabulousness.html
feminists love to claim that gender is a mere social construct, their own experience betrays their fraudulent philosophy. As <em>The Frisky</em>’s most staunch feminist, Jessica Wakeman, reveals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Women] want to be dominated: Even big-mouthed ballsy women like me enjoy being dominated! Yet dominating a woman scares a lot of men because they are afraid — rightfully so — of being rape-y. But with tons of trust and communication, she’ll be creaming her panties in no time!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wakeman initially admits her own ignorance of gender function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I look back now and see that [the men I dated] realized I loved [submitting] <em>long</em> before I did.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But <em>through actual experience</em> she later gains a valuable realization:</p>
<p>“...it was [his authority]... He had [an authoritative] personality. He could be fearless and decisive. He could be a leader. He could be stern and take charge when he needed to. He was protective... [He] dominated me in bed all the time, of course. But outside of bed, which was starting to feel like catnip in this new, weird way, I always felt ‘safe’ with him because of the way he took charge.”</p>
<p>Yes, even hardcore feminists— who routinely condemn authoritative men as “controlling” and “abusive”— admit that submitting to a man feels <em>right</em>. And as Wakeman confesses, it even feels <em><strong>pleasurable</strong></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve been pretty open about my own enjoyment with [submitting to a man] and, I promise you, <em>lots</em> of women really like it.”</p>
<p>“... the idea of [submitting to a man] aroused me more than I had ever felt before. [...] I was horny <em>constantly</em>. And I mean <em>constantly</em>. Never before in my life have I experienced such weeks-long
periods of horniness! [...] [he] was not abusive. I was <em>not</em> being hurt, nor was I unhappy. We were in a dominant/submissive relationship — or playing at one, anyway — and [submitting to his authority] got me unbelievably, <em>unbelievably</em> turned on.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, the significance of female submission is even backed by scientific studies such as the one conducted in 1973 by researcher and therapist E. Barbara Hariton. During interviews with women, Hariton discovered that the most common fantasy involved being “<em>forcefully taken</em>” by a man.</p>
<p>Such scientific observations and many others like it reveal the functional desire expressed by women to submit to male authority.</p>
<p>Author, Susannah Breslin, further confirms this innate desire by giving dating tips to men that emphasize the importance of male authority in relationships:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Take Charge</strong>. We do not want to decide where to go. We will never tell you this, but it is true.</p>
<p>“... We are interested in how you <em>portray yourself</em>. Act confident, interested,
engaged, self-assured, ambitious, and happy. We like that.</p>
<p>“... Feminism, shmeminism. [Remember when we said we were ‘strong and independent’ and didn’t need a man to take care of us?] We lied...”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She also provides the reason why women require male authority:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Frankly, as women, we’re not even sure what we want half the time, but you knew that already.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the scientific community confirms
this fundamental truth about female
design as <em>Psychology Today</em>’s News Editor, Matthew Hutson, points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A recent analysis of 20 studies over the last 30 years indicates that between 31% and 57% of women have [domination] fantasies, and these fantasies are frequent or preferred in 9% to 17% of women. Considering that [women are ashamed to report such] fantasies, these stats are most likely lowball figures."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the porn industry, which uniquely capitalizes on the social incompetence of men, sheds further light on the subject by revealing a telling fact: dominatrices can make a good living while female submissives are <em>rarely</em> in demand. Why? Because
in a market based upon the inability to attract women, male authority is largely absent from its customer base; dominant, authoritative men can <em>already</em> attract women. Thus, they have little incentive to patronize sex workers.</p>
<p>Yet even with vast amounts of evidence to the contrary, feminism still conditions women to believe that competing for male authority leads to greater happiness. This is evident in Wakeman’s own struggle with functional gender roles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“...even though I liked the feeling of [submitting to a man], I felt conflicted about giving up my physical power, thinking [this] wasn’t something an independent and
opinionated woman should enjoy. Just how, I fretted, could a partner take me seriously as a thinker, a doer, and a creator when I wanted to be submissive to him? What if people think I’m
weird or screwed up?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it’s true that women today experience much more social freedom to speak and do as they please, they also experience much more misery.
Record numbers of women now take prescription medications to numb their chronic dissatisfaction. Feminism’s dysfunctional relationship model
competes with a female’s natural submissive design, causing endless frustration. Whenever necessity competes with good intentions, the
end result is always suffering.</p>
<p>Yet, without men exercising authority over women, and without women submitting to that authority, relationships eventually break down. The mere “fantasy” of submitting to an authoritative man can never replace the reality of an emasculating culture that fails to meet the needs of women. By robbing men of their authority, feminism simultaneously deprives women of healthy male leadership. When relationships lack a stable leader, neither gender is satisfied.</p>
<p>Freedom that sacrifices necessity is meaningless; being shackled to
feminism’s fraudulent ideology mocks the very purpose of freedom; the ability to do anything becomes contemptible if it fails to meet your needs.</p>
<p>Society must recognize the value of teaching females to submit to male authority, and it must teach males how to exercise their
authority to meet everyone’s needs. Only then can men and women truly benefit from the healthy exercise of authority and submission within a relationship. When boundaries are responsibly placed to curb disorder, everyone enjoys the liberating peace of orderly relationships.</p>
